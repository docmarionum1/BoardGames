Kickstarter: The Board Game
===========================

Kickstarter: The Board Game is a game in which players compete to have the most
successful Kickstarter campaign - from the initial stages of creating the idea,
all the way through implementing the idea and fulfilling rewards.

The game is broken down into four main phases:

	- Idea Creation/Generation
	- Campaign Planning
	- Running Campaign
	- Project Implementation and Fulfillment


Set Up
------
Players start with $X and a team of X random characters?

Characters and Team Building
----------------------------
There are character cards which have different basic attributes such as 
willpower, charisma, etc., and special abilities such as programming or
cooking abilities.  

?? At the beginning of the game, players get X random characters as their
initial team or set of friends.  Their abilities may shape what kind of project
the player takes on.   

During the game players can hire additional characters to fill rolls that their
existing team can't handle.

Idea Creation
-------------
Project ideas are created using several decks of cards.

The first deck represents the category, or medium such as: tabletop game, book 
or movie.

The second deck has themes and topics such as: zombies, cats or feminism.  

A third deck (maybe?) has different project sizes and scales.  For instance a 
small, medium or large project, which could mean the difference between a short
or a feature-length film.

A card is chosen from each deck (randomly? picked from a random subset?) to 
represent the project idea.  For instance, a novel (large-scale book) about 
cats, or a card game (small-scale tabletop game) about feminism.  

Each category, topic and size card has different attributes, such as 
difficulty to market, difficulty to implement, and cost.  For example a 
blockbuster video game might be easy to market but expensive to
implement, while a short-story could be cheap, but harder to get backers for.
